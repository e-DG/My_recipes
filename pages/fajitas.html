    <p>Chicken fajitas are an easy and flavorful weeknight meal. A classic Mexican recipe, juicy chicken is seasoned, seared and cooked 
        to perfection, then tossed with sauteed bell peppers and onions. A squeeze of fresh 
        lime adds a punch of flavor and the chicken fajitas are served with warm 
        tortillas and toppings. You can't beat this healthy family favorite recipe.
